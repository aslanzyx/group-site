abstract: 'Optimizing quantum circuits is a key challenge for quantum computing. The
  PyZX compiler broke new ground by optimizing circuits via the ZX calculus, a powerful
  graphical alternative to the quantum circuit model. Still, it carries no guarantee
  of its correctness. To address this, we developed VyZX, a verified ZX-calculus in
  the Coq proof assistant. VyZX provides two distinct representations of ZX diagrams
  for ease of programming and proof: A graph-based representation for writing high-level
  functions on diagrams and a block-based representation for proving ZX diagrams equivalent.
  Through these two different views, VyZX provides the tools necessary to verify properties
  and transformations of ZX diagrams. This paper explores the proofs and design choices
  underlying VyZX and its application and the challenges of verifying a graphical
  programming language.'
