abstract: Q# is a high-level programming language from Microsoft for writing and running
  quantum programs. Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal
  specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. We aim
  to provide a formal specification and semantics for Q#, placing the language on
  a solid mathematical foundation, enabling further evolution of its design and type
  system, and leading to research in program correctness and verified compiler implementation.
  This poster describes our current progress and outlines the next steps.
