abstract: Q# is a standalone domain-specific programming language from Microsoft for
  writing and running quantum programs. Like most industrial languages, it was designed
  without a formal specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation.
  We aim to provide a formal language definition for Q#, placing the language on a
  solid mathematical foundation and enabling further evolution of its design and type
  system. This paper presents λ-Q#, an idealized version of Q# that illustrates how
  we may view Q# as a quantum Algol (algorithmic language). We show the safety properties
  enforced by λ-Q#'s type system and present its equational semantics based on a complete
  algebraic theory by Staton.
