abstract: Gate-based quantum programming languages are ubiquitous but measurement-based
  languages currently exist only on paper. This work introduces MCBeth, a quantum
  programming language which allows programmers to directly represent, program, and
  simulate measurement-based and cluster state computation by building upon the measurement
  calculus. While MCBeth programs are meant to be executed directly on hardware, to
  take advantage of current machines we also provide a compiler to gate-based instructions.
  We argue that there are clear advantages to measurement-based quantum computation
  compared to gate-based when it comes to implementing common quantum algorithms and
  distributed quantum computation.
