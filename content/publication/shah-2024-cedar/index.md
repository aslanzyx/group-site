title: 'A Lean Formalization of Cedar'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Cedar is an open source authorization policy language, developed at Amazon Web Services. Cedar follows a process called _verification-guided development_: core components are built both in Rust (the production implementation), and in Lean (the formalized specification); the two implementations are checked for equivalence via _differential random testing_. Core properties are verified by the specification. This abstract details the Lean formalization of Cedar, the first **software verification** project of this scale using the Lean theorem prover.'
