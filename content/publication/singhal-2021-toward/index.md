abstract: Q# is a high-level programming language from Microsoft for writing and running
  quantum programs. Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal
  specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. Further,
  currently, the Q# type system cannot statically prevent cloning of qubits. We aim
  to provide a formal specification and semantics for Q#, placing the language on
  a solid mathematical foundation, enabling further evolution of its design and type
  system (including enforcing no-cloning). This paper describes our current progress
  in designing λ-Q# (an idealized version of Q#), our solution to the qubit cloning
  problem in λ-Q#, and outlines the next steps.
