abstract: "As quantum computing progresses steadily from theory into practice, programmers\
  \ will face a common problem: How can they be sure that their code does what they\
  \ intend it to do? This paper presents encouraging results in the application of\
  \ mechanized proof to the domain of quantum programming in the context of the SQIR\
  \ development. It verifies the correctness of a range of a quantum algorithms including\
  \ Grover's algorithm and quantum phase estimation, a key component of Shor's algorithm.\
  \ In doing so, it aims to highlight both the successes and challenges of formal\
  \ verification in the quantum context and motivate the theorem proving community\
  \ to target quantum computing as an application domain."
