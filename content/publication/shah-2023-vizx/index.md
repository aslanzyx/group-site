title: 'Visualizing Graphical Proofs in Coq'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Working with graphical constructs in textual form can be hard. In the context of interactive theorem provers, the developer is often working with a graphical structure for an extended period of time, encountering several terms in the form of intermediate proof states. Writing a generalized translation from text to visualization for the relevant grammar can prove to be useful. Not having to “ask” for a visualization for each term is also valuable — accessing a separate tool to pipe in output from the goal state is avoidable via automation. We present ZXViz, a tool for visualizing proofs about the ZX Calculus, fully integrated with the Coq user workflow.
