Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. Further, currently, the Q\# type system cannot statically prevent cloning of qubits. We aim to provide a formal specification and semantics for Q\#, placing the language on a solid mathematical foundation, enabling further evolution of its design and type system (including enforcing no-cloning). This paper describes our current progress in designing 位-Q\# (an idealized version of Q\#), our solution to the qubit cloning problem in 位-Q\#, and outlines the next steps.},

Like most industrial languages, it was designed without a formal specification, which can naturally lead to ambiguity in its interpretation. We aim to provide a formal language definition for Q\#, placing the language on a solid mathematical foundation and enabling further evolution of its design and type system. This paper presents 位-Q\#, an idealized version of Q\# that illustrates how we may view Q\# as a quantum Algol (algorithmic language). We show the safety properties enforced by 位-Q\#'s type system and present its equational semantics based on a complete algebraic theory by Staton.},

  abstract      = {We show that Gottesman's [1998] semantics for Clifford circuits based on the Heisenberg representation can be treated as a type system that can efficiently characterize a common subset of quantum programs. Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bi-partition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) typing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this type system is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving types for the T-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. These types allow us to prove a lower bound on the number of T gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled Z gate.},
